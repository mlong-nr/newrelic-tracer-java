# New Relic OpenTracing Tracer Plugin

An OpenTracing [TracerFactory](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-tracerresolver) that utilizes the OpenTelemetry [TracerShim](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java/blob/master/opentracing_shim/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/opentracingshim/TracerShim.java) 
to convert to an OpenTelemetry Tracer. This functions as a [Tracer Plugin](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-specialagent#43-tracer-plugin) 
for the [Java SpecialAgent](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-specialagent) which provides automatic OpenTracing-based instrumentation for 3rd-party Java libraries.
 
Data collected by the Tracer is sent to New Relic by the [New Relic OpenTelemetry Exporter](https://github.com/newrelic/opentelemetry-exporters-newrelic).

### Provided Instrumentation

See [Instrumentation plugins](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-specialagent#61-instrumentation-plugins) and [rules](https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-specialagent#63-instrumented-libraries-by-existing-rules) for lists of all instrumentation provided by the SpecialAgent.

## CI
PR and master builds run on Azure Pipelines: [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/NRAzurePipelines/Java%20CI/_apis/build/status/PR%20Build%20for%20OT%20Tracer%20plugin?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/NRAzurePipelines/Java%20CI/_build/latest?definitionId=13&branchName=master)

## Getting Started: Requirements

* Java 8 or greater

## Building

`./gradlew shadowJar`

## Usage

`TODO` standalone and with java special agent 

## Testing

`TODO`

## Configuration

A New Relic [Insights API insert key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/introduction-event-api#register) is required to send data to New Relic. The Insights API insert key can be configured directly via a system property or an optional properties config file.

### Config Mechanisms

(Option 1) Individual system properties

`-Dnr.apiKey=123xyz -Dnr.serviceName=foo`

(Option 2) Config file `nr_tracer.properties` specified by the Java SpecialAgent system property

`-Dsa.config=nr_tracer.properties`

with the contents:

```
nr.apiKey=123xyz
nr.serviceName=foo
```

Additionally, while this is subject to change, the `OC_RESOURCE_LABELS` OpenConsensus environment variable currently will decorate the generated OpenTelemetry spans with attributes that you specify:

`export OC_RESOURCE_LABELS="service.name=foo,env=prod,host=bar"`

### Config Properties

| Config Key       | Value                                                     | Required |
| :--------------  | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :------  |
| `nr.apiKey`      | New Relic Insights API Insert key                         | Yes      |
| `nr.serviceName` | Display name of service, sets `service.name` on the spans | No       |
